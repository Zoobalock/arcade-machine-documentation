Spoke to IEEE about their raspberry pi escapades. They primarily used MAME for emulation. SDS pizza was ordered, and they didn't provide plates. 

Voted for pizza choice: Pappa johns wins. Evan was the sole SDS pizza voter (sad times indeed for evan).

Questions yet to be answered:
Can we use the TV as a dumb display? - Not really

Put together the conrtol box? Joystick and buttons?

Ideas:
Use the display next to grad lab. Place in a bunch of monitors...
Instead of emulation, we will write our own games on the pis.

Control Box: 
The box will be made out of acrylic, because transparency is cool.
Using Ipac for joystick control, they have linux utils, we can program using the GUI on windows.
